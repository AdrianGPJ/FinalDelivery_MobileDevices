## Getting Started

This project is a GIF app that lets you search for gifs, look at them one by one and save them as favorites.

To search you just have to type on the search bar the concept you want for your GIF and the 20 most used will appear,
if you want to see the gif with bigger proportions you can click on it and it will show you the giff, 
there you can click on the star to add the GIF into favorites.

To see the GIFs saved as favorites you just have to click on the star icon and it will redirect you to the favorites screen
where you can see them.
